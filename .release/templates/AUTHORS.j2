Below is the list of authors (and co-authors) which contributed to the repo via
commits. This list may not be accurate. Indeed, by considering only commits (for
now), I may miss contributors which help to the development through reviews,
PR/MR and other way. I may also include bots and not contributors to these bots.

If you want to be in this list for any contribution, to not hesitate to send a
mail to the maintainers.
